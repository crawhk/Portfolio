title: "Portfolio 2: TComm AI Graph"
---

> The goal of this project is to create a graph for my AI research. Specifically, the graph will display our results for our QCV Truthful Communication Scale Validation project. The graph should replicate a line graph created by Mike that has predictions (correlations) along the y-axis and the criterion variables on the x-axis. I will use this graph in my poster at an upcoming conference! 

```{r installhaven}
#install.packages("haven")
```
The haven package allows you to read in SPSS data

```{r loadhaven}
library(haven)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```


```{r reading data}
AI <- read_spss("C:/Users/crawhk23/Documents/GitHub/Portfolio/TComm AI & Human SS (Names and No Names).sav")
```

```{r}
print(AI)
```

```{r creatingmeans}
AIAvgs <- AI %>%  
  mutate(
    ExpertAvg = rowMeans(across(mf:es), na.rm = TRUE),
    AIAvg= rowMeans(across(AI1:AI6), na.rm = TRUE)
    )

```

```{r}
glimpse(AIAvgs)
```

```{r plotting}


```
